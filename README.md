# Calculator
* This is the first functional calculator I have built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. [Click here to see it](https://carolinaac.github.io/Calculator/). 
* Next versions will include:
    - Link to codepen to be replaced by github. 
    - Front end libraries such as jQuery, Bootstrap and Sass.
