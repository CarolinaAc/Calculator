# Calculator
    This is the first functional calculator I have built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
## Latest version
    New design by using Bootstrap. Quickest way of building it. Also added ON/OFF button to honor old-school calculators. It is also responsive to different screen sizes (following google chrome predetermined screens)
## Deployment
